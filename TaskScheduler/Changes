	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-A -n TaskScheduler

0.01  Sat Oct 27 10:36:21 2001
	- Edited by Umberto. Now it compiles correctly. It exports a basic
	  func I wrote to see how it works.

0.01  Sat Nov 10
	- Added functions:
	  Get/SetApplicationName
	  Get/SetParameters
	  
	  to existing:
	  Save
	  Activate
	  Enum
	  Get/SetAccountInformation
	  Get/SetTargetComputer
	  
	  First public release.

0.2 Sat Nov 17 2001 
	(Forgot to actually increment version counter on .pm :-( )
	
	Added:
	
	Get/SetPriority
	Get/SetWorkingDirectory
	Delete()

0.9 Wednesday 28 Nov 2001

	I'm ready for the big jump:
	NewWorkItem is done and works!
	
	Now you can easily add schedules.

	Second public release with full source code.

0.9.1 Saturday/Sunday 8 December 2001

	Added the follwowing functions:
	
	GetTriggerCount
	GetTrigger
	DeleteTrigger
	GetTriggerString
	
	Fixed some problems relative to GetParameters and GetWorkingDirectory.
	By now the extension is quite functional and should do all of
	the most important things. There's only a couple of not very important methods
	left to implement.
	Maybe for Xmas?

	Wrote SetTrigger and CreateTrigger on Sunday 9/12/2001.

	Should clean up code a little bit.

0.9.1.1
	 Bugfixes on memory allocation.

0.9.2 Monday 17 Dec 2001
	 Written Set/GetFlags.

1.0.0 Sunday 13/1/2002

	Written (almost) all remaining methods.
	See pm for details.
	I think the extension is ready for final Release.
	I won't be adding methods from now on, only bugfixes or
	changing the implementation (see plans).
	
	Plan: making the extension work as a tied hash,
	which is more 'perlish'.

2.0.0 Thursday 30/1/2002

	Now the extension works as a tied hash.
	Breaks backward compatibilitywith older scripts.

2.0.1 Tuesday 7/5/2002

	Fixed a bug when creating MONTHLYDATE triggers.

2.0.2 Friday 6/12/2002

	Added Set/GetMaxRunTime functions.

2.0.3 Thursday 15/1/2004

	Modified SetAccountInformation so that it accepts empty
	login and password. This is needed to be able to schedule
	a job running as System.

2.0.3a Thursday 11/3/2004

	GetFlags now returns 0 in case of error, as stated in the docs
