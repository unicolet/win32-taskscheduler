=head1 DESCRIPTION

Win32::TaskScheduler is an extension which lets you manipulate Scheduled
Tasks in Perl.

Since release 2.0.0 Win32::TaskScheduler breaks backward compatibility with scripts
which worked with earlier versions, because of a more object oriented
approach.
One of the major advantages of this approach is that you can have more than one
scheduled task 'activated' at once (copying should be easier then) and that you
don't have to type all that Win32::TaskScheduler::SomeLongMethodName stuff.

Also, I believe this is more compliant to Perl standards.
Please note that if you're happy with the old syntax you can skip upgrading since
there are no new methods nor bugfixes.

With releases in the 1.x.x series when you told Perl to use Win32::TaskScheduler
the package would automatically instantiate a COM object to let you manipulate tasks.

Now you must do that manually by calling Win32::TaskScheduler->New(). See the examples
below.

To change or view a job's settings you must Activate() it and then, until you call
another Activate() or Save() or End() , the package will continue to use that
job as the primary subject for all of the following actions.
If you modify a job's settings and need it saved then you must call Save() .
If you need to remodify that job you must call Activate() again.

The End() method releases all COM instances.

=item *

1 in case of success.

=back

=head3 $result SetTrigger($index,\%Trigger)

Sets trigger at position $index to hash %Trigger. Returns:

=over

=item *

1 in case of success.

=back

=head3 $result GetExitCode($code)

Gets the return code for the job currently active that was returned last time, if any,
the scheduler attempted to start it. Obviously the code is job dependant.
TIP: a good idea for implementing a monitor of your scheduled activities, until M$ puts some decent effort into this component,
would be to compare values returned between subsequent runs and to trigger alerts on changes.
If this is what you need to do then you might as well look at GetStatus() .
Returns:

=over

=item *

0 in case of failure

=item *

1 in case of success.

=head3 ($ms $sec $min $hour $day $dayofweek $month $year) GetNextRunTime()

returns the next run time for the currently selected task.
Time is represented as showed above. It returns undef on failure.

=head3 ($ms $sec $min $hour $day $dayofweek $month $year) GetMostRecentRunTime()

returns the next run time for the currently selected task.
Time is represented as showed above. It returns undef on failure.

=head3 $timeMilliSeconds GetMaxRunTime()

Returns the time in milliseconds that the job will be allowed to run before being sent a WM_CLOSE message.
Returns -1 if this is not set, thus allowing the job to run indefinitely, or 0 if there is
an error.

=head3 $result SetMaxRunTime($timeMilliSeconds)

Sets the time in milliseconds that the job will be allowed to run before being sent a WM_CLOSE message.
Set the value to INFINITE (see constants) to allow the task to run forever.
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

=head3 $result Run()

Execute the currently active task. Please note that the returned value only indicates whether
the call to run has succeeded, not if the execution of the task was successful. Use
GetExitCode() or GetStatus for that.

=head3 $result Terminate()

Terminates the currently selected task. To tell if your call was successfull look at
$result and the call GetStatus() .
