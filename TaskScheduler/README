TaskScheduler version 2.0.0
==========================

This package implements almost all functions useful to manage scheduled
tasks under Win32.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test [might mess your setting for certain tasks!!]
   nmake install

DEPENDENCIES

none.

NOTES

Please note that starting with major release 2 the package uses an object
oriented approach which breaks compatibility with older versions.

This new OO approach lets you have more than one tasks active at once, just call
New() as many times as you need and assign the returned hash to different variables.

If you upgrade please update your scripts too, or they won't work.
If you have the Cygwin utilities, sed, a UNIX box or any decent text
editor you can use something like this:

#sed "s/Win32::TaskScheduler::/\$scheduler->/g" test.pl > test2.pl
(for those of you not UNIX aware: substitute every occurrence of 
Win32::TaskScheduler:: with $scheduler-> in file test.pl and save new file
as test2.pl)

Then open the new file and add a line like this at the beginning, after the use
directives and before any task scheduler operation:

$scheduler=Win32::TaskScheduler->New();

That's it.
